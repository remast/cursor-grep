I created this project to learn how to use Cursor.ai to write code.

## Steps

1. create a go project with a simple grep like command line app
2. add the ability to scan several files in parallel
3. how do i call the program?
4. init my go module
5. create two big sample files to test it

## How to run

```bash
go build
gogrep -pattern "fox" sample1.txt sample2.txt
```
